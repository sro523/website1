Using the library reticulate, we can have both R chunks and python chunks within the same file! Isn't that neat


```{r}
library(reticulate)

hi<-"Hello"
```

```{python}
hi="world"
print(r.hi, hi)
```

```{r}
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```
Some other things I have done in Python involve  creating simple functions with strings.

The code below takes a string of nucleotides and uses them as the input and returns all the 3-mers present, and the number of times that each 3-mer occured with the dictionary function.

```{python}
my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
seq1list = {}
for i in range (len(my_seq1)-2):
  dna=my_seq1[i:i+3]
  if dna in seq1list:
    seq1list[dna]+=1
  else:
    seq1list[dna]=1
print(seq1list)
```
